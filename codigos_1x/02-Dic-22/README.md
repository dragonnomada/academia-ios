### Sevent Edition Chaper 1: Expressions, Variables & Contants

## Challenge 1: Variables
Declare a constant Int called myAge and set it equal to your age. Also, declare an Int
variable called dogs and set it equal to the number of dogs you own. Then imagine
you bought a new puppy and increment the dogs variable by one.

## Challenge 2: Make it compile
Modify the first line so that it compiles. Did you use var or let?

## Challenge 3: Compute the answer
Work out what answer equals when you add the following lines of code:

## Challenge 4: Add parentheses
Add as many parentheses to the following calculation, ensuring that it doesn’t
change the result of the calculation.

## Challenge 5: Average rating
Declare three constants called rating1, rating2 and rating3 of type Double and
assign each a value. Calculate the average of the three and store the result in a
constant named averageRating.

## Challenge 6: Electrical power
The power of an electrical appliance is calculated by multiplying the voltage by the
current. Declare a constant named voltage of type Double and assign it a value.
Then declare a constant called current of type Double and assign it a value. Finally,
calculate the power of the electrical appliance you’ve just created, storing it in a
constant called power of type Double.

## Challenge 7: Electrical resistance
The resistance of such an appliance can then be calculated (in a long-winded way) as
the power divided by the current squared. Calculate the resistance and store it in a
constant called resistance of type Double.

[Codigo:electrical-resistance](https://github.com/batista-eduardo-mat/batista/blob/main/02-Dic-22/02-12-22Challenge.playground/Pages/7%20Electrical%20resistance%20.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift)

## Challenge 8: Random integer
You can create a random integer number by using the function arc4random(). This
picks a number anywhere between 0 and 4294967295. You can use the modulo
operator to truncate this random number to whatever range you want. Declare a
constant randomNumber and assign it a random number generated with
arc4random(). Then calculate a constant called diceRoll and use the random
number you just found to create a random number between 1 and 6. (Hint: You will
need to include the line import Foundation to get access to arc4random(). If this
method of creating a random number seems primitive, you are right! There is an
easier, more clear and expressive way to generate random numbers you will learn
about in Chapter 4, “Advanced Control Flow”.)

## Challenge 9: Quadratic equations
A quadratic equation is something of the form a⋅x² + b⋅x + c = 0. The values of x
which satisfy this can be solved by using the equation x = (-b ± sqrt(b² -
4⋅a⋅c)) / (2⋅a). Declare three constants named a, b and c of type Double. Then
calculate the two values for x using the equation above (noting that the ± means plus
or minus — so one value of x for each). Store the results in constants called root1
and root2 of type Double.
